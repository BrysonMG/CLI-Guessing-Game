# Guessing Game
---
This is a simple, number guessing game played in the command line / terminal.

---
### How To Play
* Clone this repo.
* Open your terminal and navigate to this repo's root directory.
* Enter the command `dotnet run` (You must have .NET installed for this command to work.)
* The game should now be running!
* Tip: If you type `hint` instead of guessing a number, it will tell you what the secret number is.

### Try To Break It
Feel free to try and "break" the game by responding to the prompts in unexpected ways. There are a few different responses I have prepared for users to encounter under the right circumstances. Please let me know if you find any issues.

#### Have Fun!
